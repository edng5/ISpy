I Spy by Edward Ng (2022)
User picks an object and says its colour. The computer searches all objects of that colour in view
and guesses which object was chosen.

Uses OpenCV and NumPy

COMPLETED:

object detection

# TODOs:
# computer guesses
# map more colours
# better readibility 
# get the intersection of detecting a colour and a object
