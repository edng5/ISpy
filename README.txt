I Spy by Edward Ng (2022)
User picks an object and says its colour. The computer searches all objects of that colour in view
and guesses which object was chosen.

Uses OpenCV and NumPy
Uses COCO dataset and model
Uses ColorLabeler from (https://www.pyimagesearch.com/2016/02/15/determining-object-color-with-opencv/)

COMPLETED:
colour detection
object detection
computer guesses

# TODOs:
# map more colours
# get the intersection of detecting a colour and a object
